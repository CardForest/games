_War_ typically involves two players.
It uses a standard [French playing card deck][1].
Due to its simplicity, it is played most often by children.

Deal
----

The deck is divided evenly among the two players, giving each a down stack.
In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck - this is called, a **_battle_**.

Battle
------

The player with the higher card takes both the cards played and moves them to the bottom of their stack.

If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a **_war_**:

- Both players play the next 3 cards of their pile face down and then another (4th) card face-up.
- The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all 10 cards on the table to the bottom of their deck.
- If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats.

Ending
------

If a player runs out of cards after a battle or during a war that player immediately loses.
